# Add requirements only needed for your unittests and during development here.
# They will be installed automatically when running `python setup.py test`.
# ATTENTION: Don't remove pytest-cov and pytest as they are needed.

# This project needs to stay compatible with Python 3.5/3.6/3.7.
# Newer pytest / pytest-cov versions declare higher `python_requires` and
# therefore cannot be installed on older interpreters.
